# Real-Time Violence Detection üîç
**Using Deep Learning for CCTV and Real-Time Detection**

# Overview
* **This project explores violence detection through machine learning, leveraging two key datasets to address both classification in CCTV footage and real-time detection in live scenarios. With the growth of smart-city technologies, the goal is to enable proactive measures and contribute to safer public spaces through reliable violence detection.**
* **The models are based on a built in CNN + LSTM architecture, combining the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture temporal dynamics in sequences of frames. This hybrid approach is designed to improve accuracy and reliability in identifying violent behavior from video data.**

# Datasets üìä
* **Smart-City CCTV Violence Detection Dataset (SCVD)**
  * **For classification: Trained on CCTV footage, the model learns to classify frames as violent or non-violent, helping automate video monitoring systems in urban environments.**

* **Real-Life Violence Situations Dataset**
  * **For real-time application: Captures real-life situations for a more dynamic response in live scenarios, where immediate detection is crucial for on-the-spot security alerts.**
 
# Models and Methods ‚öôÔ∏è
* **Classification Model**
**Trained on the SCVD dataset, this model categorizes frames from CCTV footage, designed to handle complex, often low-quality visuals typical of public surveillance systems.**

* **Real-Time Detection Model**
**Developed using the Real-Life Violence Situations dataset, this model prioritizes speed and accuracy, optimized for detecting violent actions in live settings where time is of the essence.**

# Usage üé•
* **Classification: Ideal for analyzing recorded CCTV footage.**
* **Real-Time Detection: Set up with a live video feed to detect violent actions as they happen.**

# Results üìà
* **SCVD Dataset Model: Achieved an accuracy of 99%, optimized for CCTV classification.**
* **Real-Time Model: Achieved an accuracy of 95%**
